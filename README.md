# Project-Chitoge
Welcome to the Chitoge Bot Proyect! This is a discord bot intended to ease our lives and have fun with it!

In order to use this bot, you must have installed Node.js (v6.0+) and a code
editor of your choice!
Once you've done it, go with the terminal/console to the project path and type:
"node tsundere.js" and the bot should go live!
